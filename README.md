# energy-time-series-contrastive-learning
This project implements a contrastive learning framework for clustering and pattern recognition in energy consumption time series data. The goal is to apply self-supervised learning techniques to extract meaningful features from energy time series data, leveraging data augmentation methods based on self-attentiopn.
